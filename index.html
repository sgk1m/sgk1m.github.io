	<p>I am a senior engineer in Security Algorithm Lab at Samsung SDS.
		My major research topics are provable security of symmetric key cryptography, design of symmetric ciphers, and homomorphic encryption.
		Currently I am specifically interested in transciphering for approximate homomorphic encryption and design of HE-friendly ciphers.
	<p>I obtained my B.S. degree in Mathematics at POSTECH, Pohang, M.S. degree in Mathematical Sciences at KAIST, Daejeon, and Ph.D. degree in Graduate School of Information Security (GSIS) at KAIST, Daejeon.
		My advisor for M.S. degree was Prof. Sanggeun Han, and My advisor for Ph.D. degree was <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/cryptkaist/home">Prof. Jooyoung Lee</a>.
